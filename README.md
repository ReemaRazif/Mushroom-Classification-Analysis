# Mushroom_Classification
This project aims at developing a machine-learning algorithm that will determine if a certain mushroom is edible or poisonous by its specifications like cap shape, cap color, gill color, etc. using different classifiers.
### To do so, I have used the following classification methods:
#### Decision Tree Classifier
#### Logistic Regression Classifier
#### k-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
#### Support Vector Machine Classifier
#### Naive Bayes Classifier
#### Random Forest Classifier

Through classification modeling, this project aims to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.

In recent years, the popularity of mushrooms as a superfood and the understanding of their vast health benefits has surged. What used to be typically seen as just a traditional food, mushrooms are now being widely consumed and acknowledged for their healing and health abilities. With more and more people interested, foraging for mushrooms in the wild is likely to increase and I wanted to understand if edible/poisonous mushrooms could be easily identified and what that looks like.








# Conclusion
Since all the variables are categorical and data consists of many possible combinations, accuracy of all models are around 100%. But Decsion Tree and Random Forest gives the best results.
